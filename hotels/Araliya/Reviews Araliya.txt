Wonderful vacation
I’m Elena from Russia. This is my second time in Sri Lanka. But I came this Araliya beach hotel first time. It’s very beautiful hotel. Big room with bathtub.

That hotel staff was very friendly and lovely. Sanduni , kavishka, charuka was very helpful to me.

I need to thanks everyone. Hope to come next vacation. Good bye Sri Lanka and Araliya ❤️
